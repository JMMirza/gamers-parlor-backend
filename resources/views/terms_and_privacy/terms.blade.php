                    <li> No act or failure to act by Gamers Parlor will be deemed a waiver of any right contained in
                        this agreement, and any waiver by Gamers Parlor must be in writing and signed by an officer of
                        Gamers Parlor. If Gamers Parlor does expressly waive any provision of this agreement, such
                        waiver shall not be a waiver of any other provisions of this agreement, and the waived provision
                        shall not be waived for all time in the future.</li>
                    <li> If any provision or sub-provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable,
                        the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision or
                        sub-provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
                        in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties as expressed herein.</li>
                    <li> You acknowledge and agree that any violation or threatened violation of this agreement will
                        cause irreparable injury to Gamers Parlor, entitling Gamers Parlor to seek injunctive relief
                        without the necessity of proving actual damages, in addition to all other remedies at law or in
                        equity. You specifically acknowledge that money damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for
                        the injuries and damages that would be suffered and incurred by Gamers Parlor as a result of a
                        breach of any of the provisions of this agreement.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong>. Any dispute or claim arising out of or related to
                        this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of
                        Quebec, Canada without reference to any choice or conflict of laws principles. Accordingly, the
                        parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Courts in the Quebec, Canada , and hereby
                        waive any and all jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to them.</li>
                    <li> To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms of Service is
                        English.</li>
                    <li> <strong>No Joint Controller Relationships</strong>. Nothing in this agreement, the privacy
                        policy, or any document is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any joint controller
                        relationship under the General Data Protection Regulation (and similar laws) between Gamers
                        Parlor and its partners, API users, SDKs, and sites or apps that we link to.</li>
                </ol>
